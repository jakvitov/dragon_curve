# Dragon curve generator
Dragon curve is a fractal curve, that is generated by applying simple mathematical rules to a line recursively over again.

## Basic algorithm 
 You can construct the fractal by taking each line and repeatedly replacing it by two lines with a right angle and with a rotation of *Pi/2* alternatively to the right and to the left.

 You can read more about the basic algorithm and much more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve).

 ## Interface
 - In my generator, you can freely draw over the board and see a curve generated by each number of iterations from the given line. 
 - Options bar lets you choose if you want to keep the lines from the previous generation or not.

 ## Implementation

 - My implementation is recursive. We call recursively one method, that does create and draw the two hypotenuses and draw them. 
 - The checkbox with previsous generation not displayed is significantly less performant, it is caused by the fact, that my line delete algorithm is really slow and can be definitely optimised. [Currently working on it.]
